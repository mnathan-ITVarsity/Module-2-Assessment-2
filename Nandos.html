        <h1>About Nandos</h1>
        
        <p>The story of Nando‚Äôs starts hundreds of years ago with the first Portuguese explorers who set sail for the East in search of the legendary spice route. And so they landed on our shores and discovered the African Bird‚Äôs Eye Chilli or as we know it (and love it), PERi-PERi. Today, many years later, you can find Nando‚Äôs restaurants, our delicious, addictive sauces and our world-famous grocery range around the globe.
        
        PERi-PERi is the heart and soul of Nando‚Äôs. Its story is our story. For centuries the people of Southeast Africa have used PERi-PERi to bring fire to their food. It is in Mozambique‚Äôs rich soil and blistering sunshine that the African Bird‚Äôs Eye Chilli grows into its fiery best. When Portuguese explorers arrived there, they were enchanted by its flavour. They added a squeeze of lemon and a kick of garlic and turned PERi-PERi into a very well-travelled spice. Which is how, many years later it ended up in Rosettenville, Johannesburg.

One afternoon in 1987, two friends went for lunch at a humble Portuguese eatery. As their meal drew to a close, they knew they‚Äôd tasted something that had to be shared. PERi-PERi was about to make one more journey ‚Äì from Rosettenville to the world.</p>
